# Social Buzz: Social Media Content Analytics - Accenture North America Job Simulation

## Project Background
Social Buzz, founded in 2010, is a fast-growing social media platform that has transformed how people engage with content. Based in San Francisco, the company stands out by keeping users anonymous and offering over 100 unique ways to react to posts. This unique approach has attracted over 500 million monthly active users, making Social Buzz one of the fastest-growing platforms in the industry.

However, despite this rapid success, Social Buzz is still a relatively small company with only 250 employees. Most of their team focuses on maintaining the platform’s complex technology. As the company grows, they face challenges in managing their operations, preparing for an IPO next year, and handling the enormous amount of data generated by millions of users. To tackle these challenges, Social Buzz has partnered with Accenture to provide expert guidance and solutions.

The analytics team’s role in this project is to help Social Buzz understand its content better. The team will analyze user trends to identify the five most popular content categories on the platform. By uncovering these insights and evaluating how Social Buzz manages its data, the project aims to deliver recommendations that will help the company handle its growth, improve user engagement, and get ready for its next big milestones.

### Insight and Recommendation Focus:
The project explores and provides actionable insights across the following critical business dimensions:

1. **Content Popularity Analysis**,
identification of the top 5 most popular content categories, highlighting trends that drive user engagement.

2. **Category Diversity**,
evaluation of the platform’s category ecosystem by determining the total number of unique content categories.

3. **User Reaction Patterns**,
analysis of reaction volumes for the most popular category to understand its appeal and impact on audience engagement.

4. **Posting Trends**,
identification of the peak month for content posting to uncover seasonal trends and opportunities for growth.
